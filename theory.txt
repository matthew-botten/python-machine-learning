There are two ways to train a machine learning program: supervised and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning is when a set of data with known "answers" is used to train the program. Such as a set of data containing the floor area of houses linked to a set containing there values, this can then be used to predict the value of a house if it's floor area is know, this is essentially statistics at a fundamental level and a mix with data science.
Once a program is trained by either of these methods, data can be fed into it to predict outcomes. This has a vast number of applications such as for predicting which ads would most likely be clicked by certain customers.
One type of unsupervised learning is a clustering algorithm where it is given data and it tries to find a pattern to the data and group it into groups.
